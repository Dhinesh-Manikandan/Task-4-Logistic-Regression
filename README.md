# Task-5-Logistic-Regression

# Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a binary classifier using logistic regression. The workflow includes loading data (from CSV), preprocessing, model training, threshold tuning, and performance evaluation.

# Key Steps
Data Preparation: Load a binary classification dataset from a CSV file and split it into training and test sets.

Preprocessing: Standardize features to improve model performance.

Model Training: Train a logistic regression model on the training data.

Evaluation: Assess the model using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.

Threshold Tuning: Adjust the classification threshold to optimize for specific metrics (e.g., F1-score), especially important for imbalanced datasets.

# Learning Outcomes
Understand the difference between logistic and linear regression.

Learn how the sigmoid function transforms linear outputs into probabilities.

Grasp the meaning and importance of precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

See how threshold tuning can improve model performance for real-world needs.

Recognize the impact of class imbalance and how to address it.
