# Task-5-Logistic-Regression

# Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a binary classifier using logistic regression. The workflow includes loading data (from CSV), preprocessing, model training, threshold tuning, and performance evaluation.

# Key Steps
1) Data Preparation: Load a binary classification dataset from a CSV file and split it into training and test sets.

2) Preprocessing: Standardize features to improve model performance.

3) Model Training: Train a logistic regression model on the training data.

4) Evaluation: Assess the model using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.

5) Threshold Tuning: Adjust the classification threshold to optimize for specific metrics (e.g., F1-score), especially important for imbalanced datasets.

# Learning Outcomes
1) Understand the difference between logistic and linear regression.

2) Learn how the sigmoid function transforms linear outputs into probabilities.

3) Grasp the meaning and importance of precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

4) See how threshold tuning can improve model performance for real-world needs.

5) Recognize the impact of class imbalance and how to address it.
